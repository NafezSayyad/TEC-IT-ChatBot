How Do I Create a Barcode for My Product?

Barcodes for Retail Use

To generate a valid barcode for retail use, you need to register it with your local GS1 organization. Follow these steps:

Visit the GS1 website: Go to https://www.gs1.org.
Register your company: Obtain a company prefix for your barcode number.
Assign identification numbers: After receiving the GS1 company prefix, assign identification numbers to your products.
Generate the barcode: Use barcode software tools to create the required EAN-13 or UPC-A barcode.
Test the barcode: Ensure the generated barcode is tested before using it on your products.

How Can I Generate a GS1 DataMatrix?

To create a GS1 DataMatrix barcode:

Select Data Matrix as the symbology.
Set the Data Matrix format property to GS1/EAN: This adds an FNC1 on the first code word position, marking the barcode as GS1/EAN type.
Enable Escape Sequences.
Use the sequence \F to encode an FNC1 as a separator between variable-length AI fields: When the barcode reader encounters such an FNC1, it will return GS (ASCII 29).
How to Encode FNC1 in a GS1 Barcode?

To add the functional character FNC1 to your barcode data:

Enter the sequence \F where you need the FNC1.
Ensure 'Escape Sequences' are enabled in the barcode settings.
The Application Identifier will be recognized automatically in the Human Readable Text (HRT).
How to Encode GS, RS, and EOT into a 2D Barcode?

RS, GS, and EOT are ASCII control characters used to format data in a 2D barcode (see ISO/IEC 15434). To encode them:

\x1d: GS (Group Separator), ASCII Code 29 (Hex 1D)
\x1e: RS (Record Separator), ASCII Code 30 (Hex 1E)
\x04: EOT (End of Transmission), ASCII Code 4 (Hex 04)
Enable 'Escape Sequences' in the barcode properties to convert these hexadecimal sequences into their ASCII values.

Format 06 Example:

shell
Copy
Edit
[)>\x1e06\x1dSP66831000G\x1dSV9117327G\x1dS16S3.0G\x1e\x04
Note: The header and trailer of Format 06 can be encoded using Macro 06 Format (see 2D specific barcode properties).

How to Encode Binary Data (2D Codes)

To encode binary data in a 2D barcode:

Switch off code page conversion: Use encoding mode LowByte.
Force binary encoding mode if available: For example, see PDF417 encoding mode or Data Matrix EnforceBinaryEncoding.
This is relevant for applications where you encode binary data in a 2D symbol (e.g., Data Matrix).

What Are the Correct Font Settings for EAN-13 or UPC-A?

EAN-13 and UPC-A can be printed in various sizes as specified in their standards. The nominal module width is 0.330 mm (optimized for 300 dpi printers, it would be 0.339 mm). The human-readable font must be adapted to these sizes.

How to Use the Compressed Mode of Code 128?

To use the compressed mode of Code 128:

Select 'Code128' as the barcode type.
Ensure the 'Format' string is cleared.
Code 128 auto-compresses data by default, and subset switching is done automatically.

What Are Data Segments in GS1 DataBar / RSS Expanded?

GS1 DataBar Expanded (also known as RSS Expanded) symbols are constructed as a sequence of triplets, each consisting of a finder pattern between two symbol characters. Each triplet contains 2 data segments (symbol characters).

Each segment/data character encodes 12 bits.
The smallest symbol uses at least 4 symbol characters (including 1 check character) and can encode 36 bits.
Input data is processed with a character set mapping algorithm and error recognition. Predicting the number of data segments required for a given set of input characters can be complex.

TEC-IT software allows you to adjust the number of data segments per row in GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked.

How Can I Enable the 2D Composite Component for EAN-13?

To add a 2D composite component to an EAN-13 barcode:

Select the EAN-13 symbology.
Add a 2D composite component using the appropriate function:
TBarCode .NET: barcodeControl1.Barcode.CompositeSymbol.CCType = CompositeComponentTypes.Auto;
TBarCode DLL: BCSet2DCompositeComponent(pBarcode, eCC_Auto);
TBarCode OCX: TBarCode111.CompositeComponent = eCC_Auto
